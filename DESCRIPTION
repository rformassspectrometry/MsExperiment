Package: MsExperiment
Title: Infrastructure for Mass Spectrometry Experiments
Version: 1.5.1
Description: Infrastructure to store and manage all aspects related to
   a complete proteomics or metabolomics mass spectrometry (MS)
   experiment. The MsExperiment package provides light-weight and
   flexible containers for MS experiments building on the new MS
   infrastructure provided by the Spectra, QFeatures and related
   packages. Along with raw data representations, links to original
   data files and sample annotations, additional metadata or
   annotations can also be stored within the MsExperiment
   container. To guarantee maximum flexibility only minimal
   constraints are put on the type and content of the data within the
   containers.
